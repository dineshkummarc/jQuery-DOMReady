jQuery DOMReady function
========================

Description
-----------
The smallest subset possible from jQuery to support dom Ready event.

* This is taken directly (without modification) from: http://code.google.com/p/domready/
* Credit to Eliasd Torres for doing the work, I'm merely putting up on Github so more people can potentially find it.
